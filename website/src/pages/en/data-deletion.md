# Data deletion

**Last updated:** February 24, 2026

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable EU/Austrian privacy laws, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. This page explains what data we may hold, how to request its deletion, and what to expect.

## What data we may hold

Depending on how you have interacted with our Website, we may hold the following personal data:

- **Waitlist signups**: Name and email address submitted through the waitlist form
- **Contact form submissions**: Name, email address, and message content submitted through the contact form
- **Technical logs**: Basic server logs (IP address, timestamp, pages visited) retained for security purposes

We do not create user accounts, process payment information, or collect data through cookies (see our [cookie policy](/en/cookies) for details).

## How to request data deletion

To request deletion of your personal data, please send an email to:

**support@respirelabs.com**

In your request, please include:

- The email address associated with your data (e.g., the email you used for the waitlist or contact form)
- A brief description of what data you would like deleted
- Any additional information that helps us identify your records

You do not need to provide a reason for your request.

## What happens next

1. **Acknowledgement**: We will confirm receipt of your request within 5 business days.
2. **Verification**: We may ask you to verify your identity to ensure we are deleting the correct person's data. This is to protect your privacy.
3. **Processing**: Your request will be processed within **30 days** of receipt, as required by the GDPR. If we need additional time (up to a further 60 days for complex requests), we will inform you of the delay and the reasons.
4. **Confirmation**: Once your data has been deleted, we will send you a confirmation.

## Scope of deletion

Upon a valid deletion request, we will:

- Remove your name and email from the waitlist database
- Delete any contact form submissions associated with your email
- Remove your personal data from email marketing systems (e.g., Brevo/Sendinblue)

**Please note:** We may retain certain data where we have a legal obligation to do so, for example:

- Data required for compliance with legal obligations (e.g., tax or accounting records)
- Data necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims
- Anonymized or aggregated data that can no longer identify you

## Your additional rights under the GDPR

In addition to the right to erasure, you also have the right to:

- **Access**: Obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you
- **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data
- **Restriction**: Request that we limit the processing of your data
- **Portability**: Receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format
- **Objection**: Object to certain types of data processing
- **Withdraw consent**: Withdraw any previously given consent at any time

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at support@respirelabs.com.
