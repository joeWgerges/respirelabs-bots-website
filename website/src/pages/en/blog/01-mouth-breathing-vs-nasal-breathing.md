# Mouth breathing vs nasal breathing: what it means for sleep and daily energy

**Quick summary**
- Nasal breathing and mouth breathing feel similar, but they can create different comfort and habit patterns.
- Many people want to reduce mouth breathing for sleep comfort and dry mouth reasons.
- The fastest step is awareness: notice the habit and train small changes.

## Why people care about mouth breathing
Common reasons people look into mouth breathing:
- dry mouth in the morning
- snoring or noisy breathing
- waking up tired even after “enough” sleep
- wanting a simple wellness habit to improve sleep comfort

## Why awareness matters
A habit you can’t see is hard to change.
That’s why we believe detection + coaching beats guessing.

## Simple ways to build awareness (non-medical)
- During the day: check posture and whether your lips rest closed.
- Try a short breathing session: inhale/exhale gently through the nose.
- Track triggers: stress, screens, exercise intensity, and bedtime routines.

## How RespireLabs fits
RespireLabs is designed around a simple loop:
detect → nudge → train → measure progress.

## Final note
If you suspect any breathing disorder (including sleep apnea), consult a qualified clinician.
