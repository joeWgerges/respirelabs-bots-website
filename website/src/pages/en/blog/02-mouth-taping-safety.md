# Mouth taping: benefits, risks, and safer ways to approach it

**Quick summary**
- Mouth taping is popular, but evidence is limited and it can be risky for some people.
- It is not appropriate for everyone—especially if nasal breathing is obstructed or sleep apnea is suspected.
- If you try it, safety and clinician guidance matter.

## Why it became popular
Mouth taping is often used to encourage nasal breathing during sleep.

## Key risks to understand
- If nasal airflow becomes blocked (congestion, anatomy, allergies), mouth taping can be unsafe.
- Anxiety/claustrophobia and skin irritation can occur.

## Safer alternatives (non-medical)
- Work on nasal hygiene and bedtime routines
- Consider positional sleep changes
- Consult a clinician for significant snoring, choking sensations, or suspected sleep apnea

## Where RespireLabs fits
RespireLabs will provide safety guidance and clear non-diagnostic positioning.
We focus on awareness + coaching, not medical treatment.
