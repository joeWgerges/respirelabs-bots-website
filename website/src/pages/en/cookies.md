# Cookie policy

**Last updated:** February 24, 2026

This cookie policy explains how RespireLabs ("we", "us") uses cookies and similar technologies on the RespireLabs website at smartmouthtape.com (the "Website").

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or smartphone) when you visit a website. They help the website remember your preferences and understand how you interact with the site. Cookies may be "session" cookies (deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (remaining on your device for a set period or until you delete them).

## Cookies we use

### Essential cookies

Currently, the RespireLabs website does not use essential cookies. The site is built as a static website that functions without cookies by default.

### Analytics

We plan to use Matomo analytics in cookieless mode. This means analytics data is collected without storing cookies on your device. No personal identifiers are tracked, and all data is processed with respect to your privacy. When implemented, Matomo will be self-hosted or configured to store data within the EU.

### Preference storage

We use your browser's **localStorage** (not a cookie) to remember your language preference (English or German). This data stays on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.

| Storage type | Purpose | Duration | Data stored |
|---|---|---|---|
| localStorage | Language preference | Until you clear browser data | Language code (e.g., "en" or "de") |

### Third-party cookies

The RespireLabs website does not currently use any third-party cookies. We do not embed third-party tracking, social media widgets, or advertising scripts.

If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and obtain your consent where required by law.

## Your choices

### Managing cookies in your browser

You can control and delete cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:

- View what cookies are stored
- Delete individual or all cookies
- Block cookies from specific or all websites
- Set preferences for first-party and third-party cookies

Instructions for common browsers:

- **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy and Security > Cookies and other site data
- **Firefox**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data
- **Safari**: Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data
- **Edge**: Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Cookies

### Clearing localStorage

To remove the language preference stored in localStorage, you can clear your browser's site data for this website, or use your browser's developer tools to remove individual localStorage entries.

## Legal basis

Where cookies require consent under EU law (ePrivacy Directive / GDPR), we will ask for your consent before setting them. Essential cookies and cookieless analytics that do not process personal data may be used without consent, in accordance with applicable regulations.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this cookie policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.
