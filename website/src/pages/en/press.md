# Press kit

## One-liner
RespireLabs is a privacy-first breathing coach (app + optional wearable concept) that helps people reduce mouth breathing and build healthier nasal breathing habits.

## Boilerplate
RespireLabs is building a respiratory wellness system designed to connect detection, coaching, and measurable habit change. The mobile app is designed to work phone-first, with an optional Smart Mouth Tape wearable concept under development for deeper night insights. RespireLabs is a wellness product and does not provide medical diagnosis.
