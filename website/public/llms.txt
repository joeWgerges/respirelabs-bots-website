# RespireLabs

> RespireLabs is a privacy-first breathing coach (mobile app + optional Smart Mouth Tape wearable) that helps people reduce mouth breathing and build healthier nasal breathing habits—day and night. RespireLabs is a wellness product and does not diagnose or treat medical conditions.

Important notes:
- Not a medical device. No diagnosis. If you suspect sleep apnea or another sleep/breathing disorder, consult a qualified clinician.
- Privacy-by-default: core breathing detection is designed to work offline; sensitive audio is processed locally unless the user explicitly opts in.
