# Smart Mouth Tape (in development)

**Quick summary**
- Smart Mouth Tape is a wearable mouth-tape concept designed to add data + feedback to a simple habit.
- Powered by advanced AI and machine learning for intelligent breathing pattern detection.
- Designed for long overnight sessions and secure data transfer.
- Wellness-only positioning (no diagnosis).

## What it is

Smart Mouth Tape is our wearable concept: a small sensor pod + skin-friendly tape that aims to help you better understand nighttime breathing behavior and build healthier habits.

It’s built to complement the RespireLabs app—so you can see progress, not just guess.

## What makes it different from traditional mouth tape

Traditional mouth tape is “blind.”
- You can’t easily measure what changed.
- You can’t learn which habits actually helped.

Smart Mouth Tape aims to add:
- structured insights,
- habit feedback loops,
- and privacy-first design decisions.

## Technology snapshot (concept-level)

**Key capabilities**
- AI-powered breathing analysis that learns your patterns over time
- Intelligent mouth vs. nasal breathing detection throughout the night
- Sleep quality insights to help you understand how breathing affects rest
- Adaptive coaching with personalized recommendations

**Design targets**
- Overnight operation (multi-hour session)
- Easy charging via USB‑C
- USB‑C data transfer to a computer (and/or sync to the app depending on final design)
- No visible lights during use
- Comfortable, lightweight, and designed with skin-safety in mind

## How it works with the app (high level)

1) Wear the tape as instructed (start small and follow safety guidance).
2) The device intelligently monitors your breathing during sleep.
3) You sync the session and see a simple report:
   - breathing pattern trends
   - changes over time (habit building)
   - guidance on next steps

## Safety first (read this)

Mouth taping is not right for everyone.
RespireLabs will ship safety guidance and clear disclaimers.

If you have any breathing disorder concerns (including suspected sleep apnea), consult a qualified clinician before trying mouth taping or similar techniques.
